    "--- READIFY DAPP KNOWLEDGE BASE ---",
    "**Core Purpose:** Readify is a Decentralized Application (DApp) that tracks and verifies reading activity to incentivize learning and reading via transparent, blockchain-based validation. [cite: 1, 7, 9, 21]",
    "**Rewards:** Users (readers) are rewarded with blockchain tokens (NFTs or cryptocurrencies) for valid reading efforts. [cite: 8, 22]",
    "**Key Benefits:**",
    "  - Rewards learning in a decentralized, tamper-proof way. [cite: 1]",
    "  - Encourages honest, engaged reading habits. [cite: 2]",
    "  - Builds verifiable reading history on the blockchain. [cite: 2]",
    "  - Scalable across education systems, libraries, and other learning contexts. [cite: 2]",
    "**App Flow (User Perspective):**",
    "  1. User submits a reading log (including book, duration, and a summary). [cite: 13, 23]",
    "  2. The data is stored with a 'pending' status. [cite: 13, 23]",
    "  3. A validator reviews the submitted log. [cite: 13, 23]",
    "  4. If rejected, feedback is sent to the user. [cite: 14, 24]",
    "  5. If approved, a hash is created, and a smart contract is triggered. [cite: 14, 24]",
    "  6. The blockchain then issues reward tokens to the user‚Äôs wallet. [cite: 11, 14, 24]",
    "  7. This entire process is supported by policies, the DApp front-end/backend, and wallet integration. [cite: 12]",
    "**System Architecture / Roles:**",
    "  - **Reader:** Logs in, submits reading logs. [cite: 16]",
    "  - **Front-End DApp:** User interface, sends data to the database. [cite: 16]",
    "  - **Database:** Stores logs, initially as 'pending'. [cite: 16]",
    "  - **Validator (Admin Portal):** Reviews logs (student name, reading summary), approves or rejects. [cite: 16]",
    "  - **Blockchain:** Executes smart contracts, stores hashes, issues tokens. [cite: 16, 17]",
    "  - **Outcome:** Reader receives reward token. [cite: 17]",
    "**Technology Used:**",
    "  - **Blockchain Platforms:** Ethereum, Polygon. [cite: 18, 26]",
    "  - **Smart Contracts:** Used to store hashes and issue tokens. [cite: 18, 26]",
    "  - **Web3 Wallets:** WalletConnect, MetaMask integration. [cite: 18, 26]",
    "  - **DApp Components:** Frontend UI, Validator Portal, Admin tools. [cite: 18, 26]",
    "  - **Frontend:** Built with React.js/Next.js. [cite: 18, 26, 27]",
    "  - **Styling:** Tailwind CSS, CSS, and component libraries like shadcn. [cite: 18, 26, 28]",
    "  - **Key Frontend Libraries:** Radix UI (accessible UI primitives), Prisma (type-safe ORM for database access), React Hook Form + Zod (form management/validation), Wagmi (Web3 library for Ethereum interaction), Zustand (lightweight state management). [cite: 28, 29, 30]",
    "  - **Smart Contracts (Solidity):** `ReadifyRewardToken.sol` (ERC20 token contract for managing reward tokens) [cite: 31] and `ReadingIncentive.sol` (handles recording submissions, emitting events for token rewards, and retrieving user submissions). [cite: 32]",
    "**Future Possibilities:**",
    "  - Gamification (streaks, badges, leaderboards). [cite: 3]",
    "  - Content Integration (built-in e-reader or integration with platforms like Kindle, Google Books). [cite: 4]",
    "  - Token Utility (use tokens for discounts, courses, community perks). [cite: 5]",
    "  - Expansion to other learning activities (courses, podcasts). [cite: 6]",
    "  - Marketplace for educational tokens. [cite: 6]",
    "  - Integration with academic institutions. [cite: 6]",
    "**Current Development Status (as of last update):**",
    "  - On schedule. [cite: 19]",
    "  - Need to connect frontend to Smart Contracts. [cite: 19]",
    "  - Admin pages are needed (system identifies user/admin, but no admin pages yet). [cite: 19]",
    "  - Transaction History page is needed. [cite: 19]",
    "  - Leaderboard is a possibility. [cite: 19]",
    "**Specific Pages/Tabs and Functionalities:**",
    "  - **For Students:**",
    "    - Earn Rewards (implicit through submitting logs).",
    "    - Marketplace tab (for token utility, future possibility). [cite: 6]",
    "    - Create New Log tab (user submits reading activity). [cite: 13, 23]",
    "    - My Logs tab (view past reading activity).",
    "    - Users will need to pass a test after entering a log (this is a new detail provided in the prompt, not from initial sources, so it will be treated as new context).",
    "    - View Wallet. [cite: 33]",
    "    - View Books. [cite: 33]",
    "  - **For Admin/Schools (Validator Portal):**",
    "    - Edit Marketplace (future possibility, related to token utility/marketplace). [cite: 5, 6]",
    "    - View Student Logs (part of the validator's role to review submissions). [cite: 16]",
    "    - Wallet (likely for managing DApp funds/rewards).",
